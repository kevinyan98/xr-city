# XR City

In the age of universal digitization, more and more buildings are becoming media carriers. For example, facades can display dynamic content, turning buildings into platforms for media communication. In the age of technological explosion and universal informatization, bringing creativity and vitality to urban landmarks, AR art exhibitions in public spaces seamlessly integrate digital art and immersive narratives with physical environments, interacting with buildings in three-dimensional media.

In the near future, digital media and urban space will become even more intertwined. These media will not only be 2D flat content displayed on LED screens, but with XR's technical support, the media will be presented in a more vivid way.

XR City explores the possibilities of overlaying various digital interfaces to transform architectural and urban spaces into canvases for art, play and educational adventures that encourage exploration and learning. xR not only makes cities more interesting and engaging, but also entices people who are used to living indoors to go out and experience the city.
